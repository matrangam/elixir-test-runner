# Elixir Test Runner

Currently only works for project I'm working on, which is an umbrella style app running in a docker container.
Hoping to get more time to add some better ux and configurability.

## Building

```vsce package```

## Installing

```code --install-extension path/to/elixir-test-runner-0.0.1.vsix```


# TODO:

* [ ] Explore better text decoration patterns.
* [ ] Create links to failed tests in the console.
* [ ] Add support for configuration, ie test command, umbrella path, etc.
